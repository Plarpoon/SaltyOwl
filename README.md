# WoM Check Balance Bot
## Discord bot that checks the internal balance of the "World of Mounts" staff

Remember to add a file next to the executable called "bot-token.txt" (with no extension) which must contain the actual bot token from your https://discord.com/developers/ account.

- use this guide to create one if you haven't yet.
